    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 text-left">
        👤I am a researcher at the University of Bergen, Norway, specializing in High Energy Atmospheric Physics. I received my PhD from the University of Toulouse in 2015 and worked as a postdoc at the University of Paris Diderot on the TARANIS spacecraft. Then I moved to Bergen as post-doc in 2017 and then got a researcher position in 2020.

        👨‍🔬My research focuses on high-energy phenomena from thunderstorms: Terrestrial Gamma-Ray Flashes (TGFs), Gamma-Ray Glows, and Terrestrial Electron Beams. I also contribute to the calibration of the ASIM instrument on the International Space Station. My latest instrumental focus is on the development of a new gamma-ray pinhole camera to resolve Gamma-ray glows' spatial extent for the new upcoming 2028 ENLIGHTEN flight campaign.

        ⚡TGFs are intense sub-millisecond bursts of gamma rays from thunderstorms, reaching energies up to 40 MeV. Gamma-Ray Glows are weaker but longer-lived emissions (seconds to minutes). Terrestrial Electron Beams are high-energy electron streams produced alongside TGFs, detectable by satellites like Fermi, ASIM, and AGILE.

        ✨In 2023, I participated in the ALOFT flight campaign, flying at 20 km altitude over Caribbean thunderstorms. We discovered Flickering Gamma-Ray Flashes (FGFs) - a new phenomenon published in Nature (2024). FGFs are "the missing link" between glows and TGFs: they last 20-250 ms with multiple pulses, but unlike TGFs, they are radio and optically silent, which is quite puzzling.

        💫In my recent 2025 JGR Atmospheres paper, I performed a spectral analysis of 24 FGFs detected during ALOFT, showing they are consistent with the Relativistic Runaway Electron Avalanche process, producing gamma-rays up to 40 MeV at 8-16 km altitude.

        🔬I also lead the Norwegian Research Council project "What makes Flickering Gamma-ray Flashes Flicker?" From 2025-2029, funded with 11.7M NOK, investigating FGF mechanisms through multi-platform observations and computer simulations. Me and my colleagues are looking forward for the new ENLIGHTEN flight campaign coming up in 2028.
